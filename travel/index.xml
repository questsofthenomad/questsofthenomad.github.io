Hi there,
Yesterday was the beginning &amp;amp; tomorrow there will be an end though somewhere in the middle we have to focus on things we need to do. Somewhere around August 2018 with a broken clavicle and a month of bed rest, was when I decided to start blogging and it took me around 6 months to actually start a travel blog.</description>
